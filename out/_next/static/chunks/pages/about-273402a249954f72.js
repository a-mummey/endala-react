Lastly, the grid itself is dynamically generated based on unique constraints for each edges. This means that rather than having a fixed set of tiles that are placed and rotated, each tile is generated specifically for the spot where it will go. This unlocked the ability to frame the image with whitespace or allow whitespace in the middle of the grid."}),(0,i.jsx)("h2",{children:"How it's done"}),(0,i.jsx)("p",{children:"TBD"})]})};var l=function(){return(0,i.jsx)(o,{})}},8738:function(e){e.exports={about:"AboutComponent_about__shHqJ"}}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,888,179],(function(){return t=8961,e(e.s=t);var t}));var t=e.O();_N_E=t}]);
